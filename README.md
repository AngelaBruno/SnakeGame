# SnakeGame

Play as a snake eating apples and growing larger with each one. Use arrow keys to move and SPACE to pause the game. 

Notes:
The snake colliding into itself will end the game. 
Golden apples give extra points!

Modifications made:
•	Added a pause button that displays a ‘Game Paused’ screen when clicked
•	Moved players ‘Score’ so that the Pause button doesn’t overlap it
•	Drew and added graphics for the Apple, and Pause & End screens (to give the game a bit more personality)
•	Added a golden apple graphic that has a random chance of spawning (but is frequent enough)
o	If the player eats the golden apple their score increases by 3, snake does not increase by 3 units 

Things that can be added/improved upon:
•	Moving the pause button to the bottom of the screen so that it’s more easily accessible
•	Adding a restart button on the Game Over screen
•	Adding better graphics for the snake
•	Including WASD keys and not just arrow keys
•	Making the graphics a bit smaller(?)
•	Including a rotten apple that takes away 3 points from the player
